Pair programming

Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation. The programmer on the keyboard is usually called the controller, and the other known as the navigator, is also actively involved in the programming task, but is more focused on the general direction, it is suggested that often the two partners exchange places every half hour or after a unit test is done.

Couple programming focuses on the following advantages:
More discipline. By pairing correctly they are more likely to do what they have to do rather than take long breaks.
Better code. Matching is less likely to produce bad designs since your immersion tends to design with higher quality.
Constant work flow. Pairing produces a different workflow when working alone, in pairs the workflow recovers more quickly. Pairs are more resistant to interruptions as one developer deals with the interruption while the other continues to work.
Improved morale. Pair programming is more enjoyable for some programmers than programming alone
Programmers learn to work as a team.
Communication flows more often and more efficiently.
Continuous peer learning is created and it is easier for a new team member to quickly get to work and get to know the environment.

Common mistakes:
Both schedulers must actively participate in the task during a paired session; otherwise, no benefit can be expected.
A simplistic but often raised objection is that matching "doubles the costs"; That's a misconception based on equating programming with typing; however, one should keep in mind that this is the worst result of a misapplied pairing
At least the driver, and possibly both programmers, are expected to keep a comment active; Pair programming is also "programming out loud": if the driver is silent, the navigator must intervene.
